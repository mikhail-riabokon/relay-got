# Relay + GraphQL example 

This example shows how to fetch and mutate data via react-relay on client and graphql-relay on server.
Data was taken from Game of Thrones world.

# Notes
[Example](http://relay-got.herokuapp.com/) is **not** cross platform. I chacked it only in latest Chrome.
## DEVELOPMENT for WINDOWS users
In case if you want to change some code, and see result locally, do not forget to change set environment variables, and npm scripts format.
